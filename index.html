     <h3><a href="http://www.unibank.com.au">UniBank.com.au</a></h3>
     <p>We upgraded and redesigned the website in-house. As a lead designer and
     front-end developer for this project, I've expanded and built on the
     existing designs whilst still maintaining the integrity of the UniBank
     brand.</p>
     <h3><a href="http://www.tmbank.com.au">TMBank.com.au</a></h3>
     <p>TMBank collaborated with DT Digital for the re-development and re-design
     of TMBank.com.au. I oversee, review and test all design aspects of the
